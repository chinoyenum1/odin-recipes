    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update
       using an air fryer. They are just a bit denser in textuer than deep
       frying and look for a subtle hint of heat. they're perfect side-kick
       to fried fish or shrimp but they're equally good with drizzle of honey.
